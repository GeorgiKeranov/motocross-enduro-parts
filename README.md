## Theme Functionalities

### Functionalities
  - You add the parts as products with pictures, price, description and compatible motorcycles so everyone can check if this part fits on his motorcycle without calling you again and again to ask if the part will fit their motorcycle, send them pictures of it, in what condition is it and what the price is.
  - Each part (product) has associated motorcycle from who the part is disassembled. (This field can be automatically filled with motorcycle by default that you can choose from Theme Options/Motorcycle Parts Options. This is very useful if you for example add 50 more parts from the same motorcycle).
  - Each part (product) has compatible motorcycles because every part can be fit on multiple motorcycles with different make, model or year.
  - The title of the part (product) is automatically generated by the custom field title and associated compatible motorcycles to the part.
  - Users can search parts by:
    - Words
    - Make, model and year of their motorcycle for parts that will fit
    - Categories
  - Users can order parts and you will get automatically notification on the phone from the "WooCommerce" app for iPhone and Android.
  - You can attach large number of parts to one motorcycle very easy from the custom admin page "Attach Parts To Motorcycles".
  - When you change the status of the order to completed the parts from it are automatically hidden in the site because they are sold.
  - You can add promocodes for discounts.
  - You can check sales for every month by each motorcycle.
  - Every motorcycle can be checked for total sales and remaining parts for sale.
